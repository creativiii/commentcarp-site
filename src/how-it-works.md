heading: How does Commentcarp work?
---

Commentcarp is a privacy-focused solution for leaving comments on websites.

The "Post with Twitter" button is used to verify your Twitter identity, however Commentcarp ensures no information beyond your name and username are ever recorded.

Commentcarp will **never** send you emails (that's because we don't even ask you for one!) and will notify you of replies **only** if you specifically request it.

Here's the **public information** we associate with your comments:

- Your username (eg. @commentcarp)
- Your public name (eg. Comment Carp)
- Your profile photo

That's all!
