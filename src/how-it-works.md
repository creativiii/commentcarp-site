Commentcarp is a privacy-focused solution for posting comments online.

The "Post with Twitter" button is used to verify your Twitter identity, but Commentcarp ensures no information beyond your name and username is ever recorded.

Commentcarp doesn't ask for your email, and will **never** send you any (yay!). You'll only be notified of replies if you specifically request it.

Here's the **public information** we associate with your comments:

- Your username (eg. @commentcarp)
- Your public name (eg. Comment Carp)
- Your profile photo

That's it!
